   TODO: Replace some of the hard-coded in Environment EG() values (number of generations for calamity and ice age)
   		 with environmental characteristics from input args - coordinate with Natalia.
   		 Best is to add them as class instance variables and pass in via constructor in here

   TODO: Add some additional small value to mutationProbability() return value if current environment's pollution exceeds mutation threshold, like:
			if (env.getPollutionLevel => Envoronment.POLLUTION_MUTATION_THRESHOLD {randomNumber += env.getPollutionLevel/100}
		 Remember that the result should be less than 1.
		 Also, mutationProbability() will need to have current Environment as an argument
